# Web Scraping World Population 2025 Details Using Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on scraping population data for all countries from [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) using Python. The goal is to extract tabular data directly from the website and save it into an Excel file for further use or analysis.

This project is both a learning exercise in web scraping and a practical example of extracting real-world data from the web.

## ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used

- `Python` â€“ Core programming language
- `requests`: To make HTTP requests and fetch web page content
- `BeautifulSoup`: To parse and extract the HTML table
- `pandas`: To convert the parsed data into a structured DataFrame and export it to Excel

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure

```bash
web-scraping-world-population/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ world_population_2025.xlsx       # Output Excel file
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ scrape_world_population.py       # Web scraping script
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md
â”œâ”€â”€ requirements.txt
```

## Sample Output
The scraped Excel file includes the following columns:
Country (or dependency)

- `Population (2025)`

- `Yearly Change`

- `Net Change`

- `Density (P/KmÂ²)`

- `Land Area (KmÂ²)`

- `Migrants (net)`

- `Fertility Rate`

- `Median Age`

- `Urban Population %`

- `World Share`

## Future Enhancements
- Add automation using schedulers like cron or APScheduler

- Clean and transform data for easier analysis

- Visualize population trends using tools like Power BI or Matplotlib

- Export data to a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL)
