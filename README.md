# Web Scraping World Population 2025 Details Using Python

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on scraping population data for all countries from [Worldometers](https://www.worldometers.info/world-population/population-by-country/) using Python. The goal is to extract tabular data directly from the website and save it into an Excel file for further use or analysis.

This project is both a learning exercise in web scraping and a practical example of extracting real-world data from the web.
